Description

This program is a simple to-do list that organizes tasks based on their priority level. Tasks are separated into three categories: urgent, normal, and backlog. The goal of the program is to demonstrate how queues can be implemented using Python lists while managing tasks efficiently.

Design Choices

Python lists were used because they are easy to work with and flexible. Each priority level has its own list, which helps keep tasks organized and easy to manage. The program follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) rule by adding tasks to the end of the list and removing them from the front. This behavior closely matches how real-world task queues work.

Features
